### Events ###

baltimare_frtr.1.t:0 "Exiled Leader of the Communist Party of Ponies arrives in Baltimare"
baltimare_frtr.1.d:0 "Starlight Glimmer, former leader of the commune Our Town and media personality, has fled from the advancing forces of Nightmare Moon in Equestria and arrived in Baltimare. She was met with much fanfare in the press due to her personality and it became apparent she wasn’t here for safety. Instead she has made many public and passionate pleas to be allowed to serve Baltimare as a general in the Army. As Our Town was peaceful she is rather untested and as such many in the high command are hesitant to enlist her, with some even suggesting she would serve better as a propagandist, but she is insistent she serve the Revolution actively or not at all. With Nightmare Moon bearing down on our borders more and more every day we are faced with a sobering reality. No matter who wins, they will come after us not long after and when that day comes we will need everypony we can get."
baltimare_frtr.1.a:0 "Welcome aboard."
baltimare_frtr.2.t:0 "Starlight Glimmer accuses new government of Collusion!"
baltimare_frtr.2.d:0 "General Starlight Glimmer has made a fiery and indeed Revolutionary speech today from the Front declaring she had found evidence that new Baltimare government was colluding with Equestria to undermine the Revolution for their own personal gain when their state was reabsorbed due to their ‘revisionist treachery’. The government for their part shot back saying Glimmer was obviously deranged and dangerous and revoked her command while ordering her arrest. Glimmer wasted no time in fleeing the front with a cadre of loyal soldiers to an unknown location vowing to keep up the fight against ‘treachery and revisionism’. However with few allies and a united nation behind us we can easily stand up against one rogue general….right?"
baltimare_frtr.2.a:0 "This is fine."
baltimare_frtr.3.t:0 "Starlight Glimmer marches on Baltimare!"
baltimare_frtr.3.d:0 "The ominous silence from Starlight Glimmer was shattered when gunfire rattled through a radio station near Balitmare. Soon after her voice filled the airwaves as she declared ‘The True Revolution has begun!’. The government wasted no time in ordering the Baltimare Garrison to begin preliminary attempts to defeat the putsch while sending a message to nearby Army units to converge on Balitmare to mop up what was left. However they were surprised when the Garrison revolted and joined Starlight Glimmer. Not long after the first government forces arrived and the city erupted into fighting. In a display of violence not seen since the opening of the First Revolution the streets of Baltimare have run red not with the triumphant banners of Socialism but with blood."
baltimare_frtr.3.a:0 "Starlight Glimmer has seized the ship of state!"
baltimare_frtr.3.b:0 "Starlight Glimmer overplayed her hand"
baltimare_frtr.4.t:0 "Starlight Glimmer takes over the Republic of Baltimare!"
baltimare_frtr.4.d:0 "Starlight Glimmer, a former leader of Our Town, has seized control of Baltimare and declared herself General Secretary, backed by a loyal cadre of military officials. Former government loyalists are still holding out in some areas of the South East but are not expected to last long barring immediate and direct outside intervention. This surprising turn of events has been met with mixed reactions. Some have celebrated her coup as a victory for the common worker as Glimmer’s history of Harmonism and promises of reform stand in stark contrast to the regime she replaced. Others however worry that she has changed and her promises of equality and harmony are nothing more than empty words wielded by Equus’s newest military strongpony. Some even denounce her as an Equalist extremist. As the world struggles to figure out how to react to her takeover, Starlight Glimmer has begun a period of rapid militarization aiming to build up the forces to fight off the armies of reactionaries that will inevitably come marching down South. The drums of war sound once more across the South East and few can say with any certainty what the future will hold for that troubled region."
