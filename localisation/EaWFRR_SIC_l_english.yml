 sicameon_frtr_frd.1.t:0 "Collaborationists"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.1.d:0 "From Darkness comes light and from divided and fragmented rebellions come opportunities:\nOur enemies are many as the islands in the Asterionese archipelago, countless even, and even if weak and scattered far from each other they still pose a somewhat significant threat for the stability of our ever-expanding realm and, besides fighting fire with fire, the optimal option is to make way for a cold calculated series of token concessions, dividing and conquering the bulls with both terror and diplomacy.\nTo divide and conquer is necessary for the future of the empire, we arent allowed to fail.\nFor glory, stability and the future of the Kaiserreich"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.1.a:0 "Fight for our future."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.2.t:0 "Meeting with the Council"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.2.d:0 "As Sicameon's new duke, Frederick's ambitions are boundless and rooted into a sense of Imperial pride that is practically non existant in the distant lands of Sicameon, its countryside still filled with rebels and wrong-doers.\nEven if his duty and strength of will are stronger than expected, he'll need to collaborate with the former regency council to stabilize the monarchy and, Boreas willing, restore the Empire."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.2.a:0 "Fine."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.3.t:0 "A Meeting at Night"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.3.d:0 "The griffon liuteanant looked at the night sky, as the Moon slowly disappeared behind a thick cloud. The ponies of Equestria claimed it was one of their Princesses who moved the gleaming rock to the sky - what a childish stupidity, he thought. However, he was not here to lament on this, but to hammer out an agreement with the pirates and maraduers who festered the seas of the South. He looked towards the ocean, where slowly but surely, three boats touched the shore. The delegates of the pirates have arrived.\n\nThree hours later, both parties left the negotiating table, to bring the news of succes to their fellow people. The agreement they signed would allow the pirates to retain much of their indenpendence, having to pay a part of their loot towards the Empire regulary, but otherwise left undisturbed. From now on they would sail under the Imperial Flag instead of the Jolly Roger, and would assist the Navy in capturing shore cities - that they would be allowed to plunder afterwards, something they were notoriously effective in."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.3.a:0 "Here's the solution."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.4.t:0 "Rise in the South"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.4.d:0 "Unexpected news come from the southern portion of the Griffonian  Content as, in a surprising turn of events nobody would have predicted beforehand,  the newly-anointed monarch of Sicameon, Duke Frederick of Yale Gamia, has declared the creation of a "Southern Griffonian Empire",  one made in the foreign image of the Kaiserreich in the north.\nAn Herzlandisch noble and the last heir to the Duchy of Yale, Frederick had always made himself known as a clear supporter of Herzlandisch Imperialism and Monarchism, working hard to defeat southern separatism and republicanism alike.\nCrowning himself as "Kaiser Arantigos I", we do not know if Frederick's ambitions lie beyond the peaceful unification of the Empire under Grover VI's throne, many claiming that he's just a powergrabber with no notion of loyalty."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.4.a:0 "Ave Arantigos!"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.5.t:0 "Empires and Emperors."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.5.d:0 "Friderick always saw the Griffin Emperors of old as idols: Mighty rulers who united almost all of Herzland via blood and iron. And though he was not one of the Grovers, he was ready to do just the same.\nThe lands of the South, rightful posessions of the Griffonian Empire have rebelled against their rightful rulers, and created their petty fiefdoms, like if they would actually matter. But he would return them under Imperial yoke. Although he received the news about the passing of Grover V. with sorrow, he had great hopes for his son. If the young Grover would prove himself a better ruler than his father was, he would certainly try to retake the lands bound to his family and Empire by blood. If it would be so, Friderick would be awaiting his arrival, with the Southlands united under him, so that he can return them to his Emperor. And if not, there is still the choice, to retake all the Empire himself.\n\nEither way, the Empire is to be restored!"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.5.a:0 "For the Emperor!"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.6.t:0 "Affairs of the Heart"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.6.d:0 "Duke Frederick is a passionate griffon, not just on the battlefield but also in love. Cyanolisia's monarch, Countess Taillow, is surely an approachable and desirable target and her exceptionable skills, combined with her never say die personality, would provide for a much needed help in governance and day to day life both. But while both her personality and her appearance is more than appreciated the political repercussions of such a move, including a de facto annexation of her domains, are more than welcome."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.6.a:0 "She will be mine."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.7.t:0 "The Time Well Spent"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.7.d:0 "“It is a beautiful sight.”\n\n“I suppose.”\n\nDuke Frederick shuffled uncomfortably, gazing out over the bay.  Aster’s Landing was possibly the grandest city the minotaurs had, all marble columns and stone boulevards, sweeping murals and amazing works of art inside their temples and public buildings.  Even common shacks were of good make, sturdy and built with care.  Another point of example for creatures with hands, he thought.  Natural tool use, as opposed to magic adaptation, meant every creature capable of these works.\nIt was a shame, therefore, he would be instrumental in stripping this from these minotaurs.\nHe looked to the Countess, who leaned on the balcony, examining the city with a small, unidentifiable smile on her beak.  Over the time they’d worked together, he’d learned to read her expressions and body languages.  And right now, he could see, a great deal of weight and tension had been lifted from her wings. \n\n"Would the Count have been proud of this?" Asked Taillow\n\n"I believe so" confirmed Frederick "Your husband would be really happy to know that the good-willing forces of the Empire have secured peace and security on our shores by defeating the bulls. We can let him rest"\n\n"Hmph, I guess you're right, Fred""
 sicameon_frtr_frd.7.a:0 "That was great."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.8.t:0 "Proposal"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.8.d:0 "The Southern Griffonian Empire and it's monarch, Frederick of Yale Gamia, has brought a rather peculiar offer on our table:\nA marriage between Frederick and our Countess Taillow, the official reasons being the strong bond built by the two griffons in recent events and the necessity for unity between Imperial rogue states against native and republican enemies alike.\nWe have to choose carefully as accepting could very much mean the end of our nation as an independent state while refusing would cause the ire of Sicameon and would leave us alone against the Sicameonese forces.\n\nWhat will Countess Taillow choose?"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.8.a:0 "Yes!"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.8.b:0 "No."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.9.t:0 "Response"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.9.d:0 "Our diplomatic mission have reached their purposes and now we have received a definitive approval from Taillow regarding her upcoming union with our duke: while official preparations for their marriage can wait we have immediately set in motion the bureaucratic practices meant to unite the County of Cyanolisia and the Grand Duchy of Sicameon in one state, a mesmerizing political move that will bring us ever closer to the reunification of the Griffonisches Kaiserreich, with both armies and leaders now united in love, both for each other and the Imperial Herzlandisch cause."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.9.a:0 "Excellent."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.10.t:0 "Response"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.10.d:0 "Our diplomatic mission, along with our duke’s romantic advances, have failed and Countess Taillow has rejected any proposals of marriage, thus sinking any real possibilities of peaceful unifications between the two domains: it pains our majesty to do this but work is to be done,for the Kaiserreich, for the glory of a new age! To Cyanolisia!"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.10.a:0 "This means war."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.11.t:0 "Deal With the Island Nation"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.11.d:0 "Asterion and its archipelago of islands are an enigma to Griffonkind: unconquered by the emperors of old and by the Karthinian and Arantigan conquerors, these bulls pose a considerable force both navally and politically, their ports a haven for anti-Imperial dissidents and pirates alike.\nWe have no choice but to make history and to act, for the prosperity and security of the future empire and for the glory of our duke, of course."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.11.a:0 "Onward troops."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.12.t:0 "Secure Our Border"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.12.d:0 "The Rivalry between Wingbardy and Falcor is a bloody and angsty affair, one created by the tragedy that was the collapse of the Empire and Gumberto I's proclamation of Wingbardian independence, and most importantly it is still an ongoing one, the armies of Karthin ready to march into and annex their hated neighbours.\nWe have no choice but to act and secure Falcor for ourselves to secure a border with our southern rivals and to stunt their growth significantly."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.12.a:0 "Get ready troops."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.13.t:0 "Into the Mountains"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.13.d:0 "Beyond the Arahno Mountains there lies an existential threat  to our stability, not necessarily one made of guns and ideologies but one of crime, smuggling and corruption:\nRegardless of the actions taken against or with our pirate "problem", the bandits up north remain a thorn on our side, their private holdings a stain of anarchy in the already unruly mess that is the southern Griffonian subcontinent.\nWith  the former County of Blackhollow's important geopolitical position fitting like a hand in a glove to our ambitions, we see no option but the dismantle of Blackrock's bandit kingdom and the conquest of its territories."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.13.a:0 "Soon we will show them order."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.14.t:0 "Unhealthy Rivalries"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.14.d:0 "As our domains in Southern Griffonia grow larger and larger and our great victories pile up  like the Kaisers of old the ultimate struggle for the dominance of this sub-continent awaits us: the Wingbardians who, when guided by Gumberto I, played their part in shattering the Kaiserreich  have solidified their position as the hegemon of their region and their cultural group, establishing themselves as the region's new power:\nAs their riches and their armies grow, so do their ambitions of conquest and their troops carefully stand against our borders, waiting for a chance to attack us and end our endeavors to reunite Griffonia.\nAs things stand, we have no option but to attack and sack Karthin once again."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.14.a:0 "There can be only one."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.15.t:0 "Ancient Home"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.15.d:0 "Our endeavours of righteous conquest and Imperial reunification have taken us to heights we could have never imagined at the start of our journey and now we stand before Southern Griffonia's greatest prize, the birthplace of all Griffonkind and the core of Imperial identity, the Kingdom of Griffinstone:\nNow nothing but a wasteland and a shadow of its former self, taking the city for ourselves will prove very important for our claims for legitimacy."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.15.a:0 "Home sweet home."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.16.t:0 "One Last Push"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.16.d:0 "The southern Kaiserarmee is edging closer and closer to the ultimate goal, to the end of our journey: the reconquista of the Southern Griffonian subcontinent draws nearer and with it so does Duke Friederick’s recognition as a great national hero, maybe one surpassing even the Kaisers of old themselves, forever recognized as the one who corrected decades of imperial mismanagement, perhaps one day he, one way or the other, could be the one in charge of the Kaiserreich...\nThe glory awaiting us is surely great but we have to stay focused: the wild steppes of Gryphus and Gryphia make for an especially tedious battlefield and once there our soldiers will be surrounded by enemies and harsh terrain conditions and very much distant from any signs of active civilization."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.16.a:0 "Yes Yes Yes"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.17.t:0 "The Time Has Come"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.17.d:0 "The Southern Griffonian continent, from the ports of Talouse to the wild steppes of Gryphia, has been tamed and our journey is about to reach its end, the restoration of the Griffonian Empire's territorial integrity now more than a distant pipedream:\nCommunications between Duke Frederick and the Kaiser's court in Griffenheim have been relentless and official notification draws nearer and nearer:\nWhile both sides are motivated by the desire of Imperial reunification our duke hasn't shied away from asking from a number of favours coming from his Imperial Majesty, with the list of demands ranging from the return of his family's title as Dukes of Yale to minor property rights.\nWe will send an official notification to Griffenheim, they'll know what to do...."
 sicameon_frtr_frd.17.a:0 "Send telegram to Griffenheim"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.18.t:0 "The Choice"
 sicameon_frtr_frd.18.d:0 "When [From.GetLeader] first read the telegram from the Southern Griffonian Empire, the young Emperor couldn't help himself to jump around the room in joy and excitement. The Southern lands of the Empire, united and pacified, pleading allegiance to him, and wishing to be incorporated by the Empire once more. Of course he'll make sure that Frederick will be celebrated as the most loyal servant of griffonkind for this little stunt of his, but as he thinked about it, he suddenly realised, South was not united by him.\n\nAt this right moment Southern Griffonian Empire is a fully operational hegemon of the continent.

It was now day two, and although they had yet to decide who would take the reigns of power, a few notable candidates were now there.\n\nThe first option was perhaps the most obvious, at least according to the best bred on the council. Duke Frederick of Yale-Gamia, the Herzlander. Technically the legitimate heir to the throne, the duke laid claim through his father (who had sold the Duchy of Yaledom to the universities), whose grandfather in turn originally laid claim to Sicameon. Unfortunately, in the modern world claims of legitimacy fall on deaf ears. The vast majority of the country are repelled by his autocratic tendencies and worse yet the populace is disgusted by his wholehearted embrace of Imperial nostalgia.\n\nAnother well-bred option is Tomado of Bronfeld, the crown prince of Brodfeld. Now in exile, he fled his home country after it broke out into civil war between the communists and supporters of his tyrannical and mad father, King Kloseu. His harmonic values are beyond question, most council members have noted the increased animosity and fieryness in his speeches, more than ofter decrying the 'disgustingly decadent political order left behind by the failed Herzlander Empire'.\nRegardless of his extravagant views, the exiled crown prince has established himself as a very charismatic and intelligent figure in his new Sicameonese home.\n\nThe last candidate is Petronila of Midoria, whose pedigree is the least established – unless you count the opinion of the commoners. His nationalist credentials are well-understood, especially given his concern for the Sicameonese minorities in Gryphus that he aspires to help. Despite his relatively humble origins and curious behaviours, he does have a genuine desire to improve the lot of the common people while strengthening the nation and his rural populist and religious stances differentiate him from the other candidates, to the pleasure of the populace\n\nFinally, the council decides.

They wondered what this meeting was about, rumours have been circulated for weeks about a new alliance made by their illustrious leader. But only time would tell if he was here to discuss it. Indeed as the thought of their leader came to mind, the man while took to the stage. Alexis Vidrio.\n\nHe looked upon the Republicans that waited anxiously for his words, the whispers and murmurs soon faded away. They all looked up and waited for him to speak.\n\n“My friends,” he began, “I know these are trying times and I appreciate your patience. But the time to act is soon upon us. We must take the first steps to begin organising for the fall of the regency. Its despotic and imperialist dogma must end, only together can we-”\n\nBefore he could finish, a voice from the crowd yelled out. “We don’t want some empty speech!

Are we allied with criminals and pirates now?!”\n\n“We are no better than the regency if that’s the case!”\n\nWhat started as a handful of disgruntled voices soon spread more and more. Vidrio sighed, the rumours of an alliance with the known pirate Don Espadarte had been spreading like wildfire. He had hoped not to need to worry about this coming out but now he had no choice.\n\n“What possible reason could we have to-”\n\n“Tell me...how many of you know how to operate a destroyer?” The room was silent. “No one? How many of you can get up enough supplies to supply our men?’ Once more, there was only silence. “And I don’t suppose any of you have a fleet of ships lying around that can intercept their fleet?” And for one final time...silence. “It breaks my heart that we must do this, but regardless of his current occupation Don Espadarte is a talented and experienced admiral. Something we need. I know this is disappointing...but you have my vow...once our republic is secured...I will personally tear Espadarte down, destroy his fleet piece by piece.”\n\nMany of those in the crowd made murmurs of agreement, their confidence restored as he continued to speak.

However, he was not here to lament on this, but to hammer out an agreement with the pirates and maraduers who festered the seas of the South. He looked towards the ocean, where slowly but surely, three boats touched the shore. The delegates of the pirates have arrived.\n\nThree hours later, both parties left the negotiating table, to bring the news of succes to their fellow people. The agreement they signed would allow the pirates to retain much of their indenpendence, having to pay a part of their loot towards the Empire regulary, but otherwise left undisturbed.

An ever-growing number of upstart politicians line their own pockets with bribe money while the average citizen lives in fear of going outside at night.\n\nTo add to this, the popularity of our ruling Regency Council, having previously been uneasy, has recently begun to decay at an alarming rate. Republican parties have captured the hearts of a concerning swathe of the population, which looks increasingly towards revolution due to the uncompromising nature of our rule. The indecisiveness of the Regency Council towards electing a monarch does little to recover the government’s reputation, either.\n\nWe are left with two different possible approaches. The Regency Council should either focus all of its efforts on suppressing dissent or electing a monarch. Although getting a king on the throne may yet prove itself an indomitable task given the situation, it would solve some of our more immediate problems and help get the nation back on the right track. That said, facing our enemies head on would likely prove a less difficult but more risky effort. The choice ultimately falls to the Regency Council, which, in a rare moment of unity, decides… "

Grover II, desiring eastern supply routes to Cyanolisia and Minotauria, crushed the parishes and established a new Grand Duchy in its place. Many assumed that the first democracy of Herzland have passed away.\n\nThey were right!\n\nFor decades the loyal followers of the Parishes launched revolt after revolt, continuing to be a thorn in the Empire~s side.
